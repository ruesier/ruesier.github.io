## Cover Letter
To whom it may concern,

I hope you are doing well. Many Companies are taking on many interesting challenges, including artificial intelligence and Cloud Computing. I believe that I will be great addition to your team with my skills in software development and team coordination.

I gained experience in my skills while working for a startup I helped found, named Maxset Worldwide Inc. I developed a system for organizing raw text using a natural language processing scheme. I was then able to build a a web stack to use this system to organize and search files based on dynamically generated data tags.

While working for Maxset Worldwide Inc, I have had a wide range of experiences. I installed servers into a datacenter. I lead 2 other developers in the release of new features. I met with customers to develop system requirements.

I hope I can have even more experiences with you,
Devon Call
